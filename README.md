### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is RamÃ³n Mendoza
I am a software engineer at UnADM. Like many others I started learning front-end development so I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and ReactJS. But I like programming logic more than I do designing websites, so I prefer to develop as a back-end developer with Python in Django and Flask. Python is my main choice because I love working with it and learning more and more about the language as it seems to me a very well structured and very extensive functional and object oriented programming framework.

I am a very enthusiastic programmer, and Linux user; I study vim and bash scripting pretty much as a hobbie, and I am also an avid science fiction reader and yoga practitioner.

Besides, through my school, courses and independent projects I have also touched on many other useful technologies and skills such as: C, Java and design and architectural patterns. In Java I have also learned almost everything I know about data structure and algorithms. I have worked my way through "cloud computing", where I have learned to work with Docker, Kubernetes with K3s and test clusters with Kind, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, and configuration templates with Helm.
