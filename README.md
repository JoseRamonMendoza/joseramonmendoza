### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is RamÃ³n Mendoza
#### I am a software engineer at UnADM. 
Like many others I started learning front-end development so I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and ReactJS. But I like programming logic more than design so I preferred to develop as a back-end developer with Python in Django and Flask, I chose Python because I love working with it and learning more about the language as it seems to me a very nice language, well structured and very extensive.

I am a very enthusiastic programmer, and also a very enthusiastic Linux user; I study vim and bash scripting as a hobbie, I am also an avid science fiction reader and yoga enthusiast.

Besides, through my school and/or through courses or independent projects I have also touched on many other useful technologies and skills such as: C; Java, design patterns and architecture, in Java I also learned almost everything I know about data structure and algorithms; Cloud computing, where I learned to work with Docker, Kubernetes with K3s or test clusters with Kind, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, and configuration templates with Helm.
